upgrade:
  - The following list of exceptions have been deprecated
    since 0.10.0 release -- ``Conflict``, ``ForbiddenPublicSubject``
    ``ProtectedSubjectDelete``, ``BadDriverConfiguration``,
    ``InvalidRedirect``, ``WorkerCreationFailure``,
    ``SchemaLoadError``, ``InvalidObject``,
    ``UnsupportedHeaderFeature``, ``SubjectDataNotFound``,
    ``InvalidParameterValue``, ``InvalidSubjectStatusTransition``.
    This release removes these exceptions so any remnant
    consumption of the same must be avoided/removed.
