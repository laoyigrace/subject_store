features:
  - Implemented subject uploading, downloading and deletion for cinder store.
    It also supports new settings to put subject volumes into a specific project
    to hide them from users and to control them based on ACL of the subjects.
    Note that cinder store is currently considered experimental, so
    current deployers should be aware that the use of it in production right
    now may be risky.
